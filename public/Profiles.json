She holds a Juris Doctor (Law) degree and a Master of Laws, which examined the relationship between the taxation provisions of the Indian Act and the Numbered Treaties. She has conducted research in New Zealand and Australia on Constitutional inclusion of Indigenous peoples, and has presented on this research in multiple international forums. In response to Canada’s recent celebration of colonization, she co-edited Surviving Canada: Indigenous Peoples Celebrate 150 Years of Betrayal (2017). She received her Call to the Manitoba Bar in 2018, and practiced Aboriginal law, working with First Nations in Manitoba. Myra’s legal work and teaching spans topics in governance, community sustainable development, and taxation. Her research currently focuses on social justice in the areas of First Nations children, policy development, and health equity. Advancing conciliation and social justice for and with Indigenous peoples, including within the academe, drives Myra’s service, research, and teaching."
