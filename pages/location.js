                In 1876 the Cree, Dene Suline, Saulteaux, and Nakota Sioux
                peoples signed Treaty 6 to share the land to the depth of a plow
                with the Queen&apos;s representatives. Although a treaty was
                signed between sovereign nations, Indigenous people were
                subjected to the colonial Indian Act and reserve system. There
                are eight MÃ©tis settlements established in the last years of the
                Great Depression. Athabasca University is located within Treaty
                6 territory in the town of Athabasca. The Athabasca River
                separates Treaty 6 and Treaty 8 located to the north. There are
                eleven numbered treaties across Canada signed between 1871 and
                1921.
